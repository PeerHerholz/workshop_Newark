    "To answer this question we can use something that is called a **Searchlight** approach. The searchlight approach was first proposed by [Kriegeskorte et al., 2006](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/985c/ceaca8606443f9129616a26bbbbf952f2d7f.pdf). It is a widely used approach for the study of the fine-grained patterns of information in fMRI analysis. Its principle is relatively simple: a small group of neighboring features is extracted from the data, and the prediction function is instantiated on these features only. The resulting prediction accuracy is thus associated with all the features within the group, or only with the feature on the center. This yields a map of local fine-grained information, that can be used for assessing hypothesis on the local spatial layout of the neural code under investigation.\n",
