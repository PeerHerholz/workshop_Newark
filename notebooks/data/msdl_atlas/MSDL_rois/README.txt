An atlas of group-level regions extracted from resting-state fMRI by
multi-subject dictionary learning (MSDL). The labels are given in the csv
file. The names of the regions are just provided as a useful way to plot
a correlation matrix (as in Varoquaux&Craddock NeuroImage 2013). They
are not meant to reflect a well-thought or final labelling.
